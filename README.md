## CRWN Clothing Portifolio Application

This app is a display of react and redux studies. It's a fully functional webstore with integrations with `firebase` | `Google OAuth` | `stripe payments` | `redux` | `react hooks` | `styled components` | `react saga` and more.

Live demo: https://crwn-clothing-gp.herokuapp.com/
  *This site is deployed in Heroku Paas in a free tier, so it would take a couple of minutes to load on the first access.
